## Step-Back Analysis

1. Looking at our goal, what is the *immediate prerequisite state* that must exist right before we achieve the final result?

2. What tools or information do we need to move from that prerequisite state to the goal state?

3. Continue working backwards - what must be true before that prerequisite can be achieved?

4. Have we reached actions that can be taken from our current state? If not, continue the step-back questioning.

5. Based on this analysis, what is the next concrete action to take using available tools?

## Next Action Decision

Given the available tools and our current position in the plan, what is the most appropriate next action? Be specific about:
- Which tool to use
- What parameters to provide
- What information to gather
- How this advances our plan
